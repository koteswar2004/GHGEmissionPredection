# GHGEmissionPrediction
Prediction of GHGs by using a regression model and a previously available (2010-2016) dataset 


 Objective: To help engineers predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different industries and commodities across years, making it easy to identify hotspots, reduce environmental impact, and support sustainable decision-making.

 1. Data Collection: Loaded data from an Excel workbook containing annual GHG emissions (2010–2016).

Combined data for both commodities and industries. Reason: To have a comprehensive view of emissions across years and sectors.

 2. Preprocessing: Checked columns and identified missing values.

Dropped columns with too many missing entries.

Filled remaining gaps with statistical values (median for numbers, mode for text). Reason: To ensure clean, accurate data for reliable modeling.

 3. Model Development: Created a foundation for applying Machine Learning techniques (such as Random Forest).

Included libraries for plotting and evaluation. Reason: To enable future prediction, trend detection, and “what‑if” analyses.



 Overall Benefit: This project allows engineers and analysts to quickly:

Understand GHG emission trends across industries and commodities.

Identify which areas have the biggest environmental impact.

Make informed decisions for reducing emissions, optimizing supply chains, and achieving sustainability targets
